# Skelothan's Portfolio Website

This is a portfolio website I made for myself in Ruby on Rails. Normally, this document would describe deployment instructions and such, but I don't really expect anyone to want to deploy this site aside from me.

For more information on what I did here and why, please see [this project's page on my website.](https://skelothan.dev/projects/3/)
